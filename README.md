# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-learning
The Customer Churn Prediction Project effectively provides an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting and preventing customer churn. Through the use of synthetic data and a structured ChurnPredictor class, it obtains high prediction performance with XGBoost (~0.85-0.90 AUC) and detects essential churn drivers such as month-to-month contracts and intensive support calls. The project offers practical suggestions, including customer targeting for high-risk customers and support quality enhancement, and estimates a 15-25% churn decrease and $500K-$1M in lost revenue annually. Its scalable nature provides room for adjustment to suit real-world scenarios, and it is useful for maximizing customer retention and business value.
